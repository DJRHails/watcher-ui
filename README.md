## :wrench: Technology

Watcher UI is built on the shoulders of giants!

At it's core it is uses [Styled Components] & [Styled System]. For its layout components it utilises [Reflexbox] and to keep the components modular and documentation inline I use [Storybook]. It uses [Rimble] Icons.

### Inspiration
- [World Food Programme UI Kit]
- [Rimble]
- [Aragon UI]

[Styled System]:https://https://styled-system.com/
[Reflexbox]:https://rebassjs.org/reflexbox/
[Storybook]:https://storybook.js.org/
[Rimble]:https://rimble.consensys.design/

## :gear: Installation

```sh
# Go to your favourite directory and clone
git clone git@github.com:DJRHails/watcher-ui.git && cd watcher-ui

# Install all depedencies
yarn install

# 🎉 that’s it, you've installed repo locally. One last step!
```

### Running the code locally

##### `yarn storybook`

Runs Storybook in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009) to view it in the browser.

The stories will reload if you make edits.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
